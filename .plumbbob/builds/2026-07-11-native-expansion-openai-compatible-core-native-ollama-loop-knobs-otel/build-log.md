<!--
build-log.md — your live ledger for execution. Append constantly; reorganize at
step boundaries. The antidote to "my plan got lost in the noise."

  Steps     : where you are. One step in flight at a time.
  Park list : where ideas go so you do not chase them. CAPTURE, never act inline.
  Harvest   : the boundary ritual that keeps you on one branch.
  Log       : the build's history. `plumbbob checkpoint` appends a line per step as it
              lands; feeds the /pb-finish report, which rides the branch into the PR.

# Build log — Native expansion: OpenAI-compatible core, native Ollama, loop knobs, otel

**Current step:** none (at the boundary)
**Heavy check:** checkride (set a "check" key in .plumbbob/settings.json to override)

## Steps

*(Mirror of intent.md's Steps, with live status. Only ONE step is in flight. A step
is done only after a checkpoint — check green + checkpoint taken, via `/pb-verify` or
`/pb-build`.)*

- ☐ 1. <step>

## Park list

> Mid-step, every new problem / idea / "ooh what if" lands HERE, untouched, and you
> go straight back to the step. Acting the instant an idea arrives is the disease.
> Capture is one line (`/pb-park` composes it). Harvest happens only at the boundary.

## Harvest  *(run `/pb-harvest` at each step boundary, after green)*

Classify each parked item as exactly ONE. Naming it before acting is what keeps you
from sprawling across branches.

| Class            | Meaning                                   | Action                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **blocker**      | Plan was wrong/incomplete; can't proceed  | `/pb-revert`, fold into intent  |
| **tangent**      | A different path, not clearly better      | Defer or kill. Default here.    |
| **pivot signal** | Evidence the whole approach is wrong      | Stop. Replan deliberately.      |

> Reality check: almost everything that *feels* like a pivot is a tangent. Require a
> failed assumption, not a shinier idea, before you pivot.

Harvest results this boundary:

## Log

*(The build's history, oldest first. `plumbbob checkpoint` appends a dated line here
every time a step lands — via `/pb-build` or `/pb-verify` — so this
fills in as you go, not at the end. Add your own decision/event lines too: this is what
you point at to say "I did that — the LLM helped, but those were my calls."
`/pb-finish` reads this for the report; `plumbbob finish` commits it with the build
folder, so it rides the branch into the PR.)*
